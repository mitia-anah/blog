      <p> My name is Rosny, I am from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdagascar">Madagascar.</a>
        A thing that I would like to share with is that my background and my family's profession.I grew up in a village
        called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromba">Andromba</a> which
        is a town and commune in Madagascar. It belongs to the district of Ambatondrazaka, which is a part of
        Alaotra-Mangoro Region.The majority of the population were working in fishing before
        because there was no job which the resident could do in that village.Currently,there are already a big progress in
        our town. There are categories of schooling in our village, such as public, private and secondary school as well. My Dad works as a fisherman and farmer but my Mum is a food seller.

        What is this town special for?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This town is very special for farming because it has huge ricefield to farm. Most of the people are based on farming and planting. the vast majority of the resident are working in a ricefield and the other doing another job like planting vegetable or farming edible animals.
      </p>
      <p>This is one of my memorible picture which I took when I went to a ricefield quite near to our own. These people are transplanting rice.
