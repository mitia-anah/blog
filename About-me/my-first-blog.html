      <p> My name is Rosny, I am from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdagascar">Madagascar.</a>
        A thing that I would like to share with is that my background and my family's profession.I grew up in a village called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromba">Andromba</a> which
        is a town and commune in Madagascar. It belongs to the district of Ambatondrazaka, which is a part of Alaotra-Mangoro Region. The population of the commune was estimated to be approximately 3,000 in 2001 commune census. Only primary schooling is available in 2001 but nowadays,it has already secondary schooling . The majority 52% of the population were working in fishing before
        because there was no job which the resident could do in that village.Currently,there are already a big progress in our town. My Dad works as a fisherman and farmer but my Mum is a food seller.
