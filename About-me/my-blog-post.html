        <p> What is nature? All things arround us or everything that God created are called nature. It was not made to be destroyed but given to be cared. That means, we should not pollute our environment because it affects those natural things surrounding us. Surprisingly, though, we humans only destroy that environment. We cut down the trees for firewood, and kill all the animals that live in the forest for food. The result of all this is that the natural beauty, that is supposed to share in our lives and refresh our spirits is destroyed. </p>
        <p> There are so many natural creatures that are so fascinating to look at. If we just look at the beauty of the flowers. The flowers in our life really do have a special purpose, especially for young people. Not only young people, but anything that is decorated with flowers is completely different. So if these creatures are of such beauty and beauty, why do we ruin them?

          We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out.</p>
          <p>flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, 
          and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food
